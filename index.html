        <h2>Biography</h2>
          
           <h3> Where am I from?</h3>
            <p> I'm originally from Azerbaijan, a country in southwestern Asia bordered by four countries: Iran, Armenia, Georgia, and Russia. Azerbaijan's capital is Baku, which comes from the Persian "Bâd-kube" (city of winds) and is indeed a very windy city. Located on the shore of the Caspian Sea, the city combines ancient and modern architecture. Azerbaijan is known for its delicious black tea (a significant part of Azerbaijani culture), aromatic spices, ancient mountains, and heartwarming people who welcome all cultures.
           I speak Russian (since Azerbaijan was a part of the USSR), English, and a bit of Azerbaijani and Hebrew (the language of my great-grandfather). In 2013, at the age of 16, my family and I moved to Calgary, Canada, where I had the opportunity to learn about different cultures, make new friends, try amazing dishes from different cuisines, and plan my future.</p>
       
     <h3>My interests and hobbies</h3>
      <p>
          My main passion is drawing, particularly in the realm of traditional art, using various media like watercolors, markers, and colored pencils. I've been drawing since my childhood, purely for the joy of it during my free time. There was a time when I experienced a severe art block, as I was pushing myself toward an elusive perfectionism, disregarding the pleasure in the creative process and the expression of my emotions and moods. However, a recent shift in my mindset has brought about a liberating change. I've learned to let go of my fears when faced with a blank sheet of paper. Now, I embrace the freedom of artistic expression. 
         I'm also deeply passionate about photography, currently using my mobile phone camera. My photography centers around capturing the world that surrounds me, with a special emphasis on the beauty and life found in nature. I enjoy documenting the details of our natural world and its inhabitants. Additionally, (with the permission of my friends, of course!) I love capturing their moments and expressions, preserving those shared memories. In my photographic journey, I've discovered the profound beauty in the simplicity of everyday life.
         In my free time, I love to read fantasy and science fiction books, as well as poetry. I also enjoy writing my own poems on various topics and creating short stories.
      </p>

     <h3>My goals</h3>
      <p>
         My main goal is to create what I love, to invest in it with all my heart as a personal interest, and for the purpose of my future career. I don’t plan to stop at just one thing: the world of my chosen path is vast, offering many opportunities to express myself with current technologies. In the future, I plan to open my own small online business or several, focusing on photography and directing, illustrations, web design, and graphic design.
